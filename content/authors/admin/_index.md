Yaé U. Gaba is presently a postdoc  researcher at Quantum Leap Africa (QLA). His main interest is in geometric and variational methods in data analysis. The key job there is to design tools from Geometry and Functional Analysis useful in analysing and visualisation data. He is primarily interested in Geometric Deep Learning and Graph Based Learning. As a topologist, his work also seeks for the applications of Asymmetric Topology to the complexity analysis of algorithms.
